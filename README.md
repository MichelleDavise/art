# The basic Shading

There are thing you need to know when you really want to learn how to draw, but before that you need to point it out what are the basic things to do before creating your very own subject. 

It is not necessary if you are an expert or an amateur; the most important thing is you know you are good and confident that your idea is an art. Keep in mind that art is simply your emotion, your feelings and that will result to quaint object. 

Start by sketching a shape, then a movement of a body: the length, the gender and the emotions. Look an example below. This basic drawing is made from pencil on paper, [bespoke suit](http://harrisandzei.com) and continually I created the partial body on digital.
